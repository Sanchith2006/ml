hi this repository contains source codes,videos,sample prototype and evidences for the project based on motion video amplification in aerospace industry for testing the quality of components while manufacturing.

Motion Video Amplification (MAV) aims to enhance subtle motion patterns in video footage.

algorithems that have been used here are: Frequency domain method using fourier transform,Optical flow algorithm called Lucas-Kanade to estimate motion vectors between frames. By analyzing these vectors, regions with significant motion can be amplified and
hybrid approach by combining  optical flow-based region selection with frequency domain processing for amplifying the video and  extractingn the features that are moving from frame to frame.

the processed video is given has the input to the qnn model that detects defects at micro scales and generates report with solution and  Vibration amplitudes and mode shape are determined. Time waveform and FFT spectrum is captured.
